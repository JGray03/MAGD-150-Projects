# MAGD-150-Projects
This is a repository for my favorite MAGD 150 lab projects.

# MAGD Lab 02
[Lab 02](https://github.com/JGray03/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab02_Gray) 
This Project was one of the first ones that I did. It is about color and the theme for the project is space. It incorperates different color modes and shapes to show the main theme in different ways.

# MAGD Lab 04
[Lab 04](https://github.com/JGray03/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab04_Gray)
The theme for this lab is Pizza. It incorperates many functions likes mousePressed and keyPressed which allows the pizza to be made with these functions. This allows the lab to be interactive and fun to use.

# MAGD Lab 05
[lab 05](https://github.com/JGray03/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab05_Gray)
This lab is about Television and the various ways for it to be interactive. There are buttons that the user can press to turn on and off the TV and others too. 

# MAGD Lab 07
[lab 07](https://github.com/JGray03/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab07_Gray)
This lab is about autuum and it shows leaves falling or floating to represent that. This lab required loops for the leaves to float and if then statements to make it work.

# MAGD Lab 10
[lab 10](https://github.com/JGray03/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab10_Gray)
This lab required 3D objects to spin and rotate. I put pictures of maps on the objects and there is also a camera that the user can move which makes it interactive.
